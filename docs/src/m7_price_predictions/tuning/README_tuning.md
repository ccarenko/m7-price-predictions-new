The model tuning is performed using the `hyperopt` package. The objective function aims at minimising the averaged quantile loss from all the quantile predictions made 3, 6, 9 and 12 SP ahead of time. Each set of predictions is weighted towards the final output using weights that decay the further we get to delivery. The average weighting given to each of these is - [1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4] respectively.
Rolling cross validation is performed within the tuning process so results recreate real life situations. This means, that for each hyperparameter combination the model is retrained and tested on a new set of data n number of times (n being the split number), before averaging the results.
